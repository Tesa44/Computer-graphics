# Computer Graphics Course Tasks
This repository contains a collection of tasks and projects completed during the Computer Graphics course. The tasks focus on key aspects of computer graphics, including 3D object modeling, scene lighting, texture mapping, and real-time rendering. The projects were developed using OpenGL, allowing for the generation of 3D scenes from scratch and navigation within those virtual environments.
## Project Highlights
* 3D Object Modeling: Creating and texturing various 3D models. 

* Scene Lighting: Implementing realistic lighting effects to enhance visual realism.

* Real-time Rendering: Optimizing scenes and models for efficient rendering.

* OpenGL: Utilization of OpenGL for 3D scene generation and interaction.
